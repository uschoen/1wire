The EasyHomeControl gateway script is part of a other projekt. the configuration is a xml base config file. 
To understand the configuratio, open the  example config file (config_example.txt), and read the individual
dokumantion for each section. 

To start up the script use ./EHCgateway.pl --configfile [path of the file] --daemon [true||false].
you have to start the script with 2 option.

--configfile [path of the file] ---->insert the path and name (from root dir) of the configuration file like (/usr/local/easyHC/conf/config.txt
--daemon [true||false] ----> if you want to run as daemon use true

you have following section in the config file.
<opt>
	<daemon>true</daemon>
	<path>/usr/local/easyHC</path>
	<pidfile>/var/run/EHCgateway.pid</pidfile>
	<gateways>
	... see at the gateway_config.txt
	</gateways>
	<connectors>
	...	see at the connectors_config.txt
	</connectors>
   <logging>
   ... see at the logger_config.txt
   </logging> 
</opt>

<daemon>true</daemon>
the option --daemon overwrite the config setting. if set daemon to true, the script runs in backround

<path>/usr/local/easyHC</path>
the path of the script

<pidfile>/var/run/EHCgateway.pid</pidfile>
pidfile of the EHCgetway, must the the same path like the init.d script
